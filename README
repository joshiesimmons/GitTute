You're going to make a wedding. To do this, you need to populate a roster (for both the Wedding Party and the Guests), you need to come up with a playlist, and you need to decide on a menu.

The first thing you're going to need to do is clone the repository. The repository URL: https://github.com/joshiesimmons/GitTute

Then, you're going to create a branch. Call the branch whatever you want. You will make your commits in your branch. To practice commits and writing messages, you should commit any time you make a change. For example, populate one text file then commit before you start on another one.

Roster:

Wedding Party -- create two files in Wedding Party; one for the bride and one for the groom. There is no maximum but there is a minimum of 3 people for each person getting married. A simple text document with first and last name on each line (designate a Matron of Honor with 'M' and a Best Man with a 'B')

Bride.txt will have something like:

Jane Doe (M)
Hoochie Coochie etc

Groom.txt will have something like:

Shitbird Supreme (B)
Joshie Simmons

Menu:

For Food

Create two files -- One file containing an appetizer, entree, and dessert. They can be anything but the entree has to be a meat dish. The other file will be vegan options -- same format, appetizer, entree, and dessert.

For Drink

Just create one file listing a few cocktails and beer brands.

Music:

Just create a file that has a list of songs and artists, minimum of 5.

Ex: 'Freewill' - Rush
    'Winona's Big Brown Beaver' - Primus
